                    p  You can open any of the files in your browser to see it in action, or modify their markup or content to suit your needs.
                    p  If you will be using Gulp the help you with your work, these HTML files will be used by Gulp during the development.

                            code /css
                            |  - main theme stylesheet (style.default.css) and its minified counterpart.
                        li
                            code /docs
                            |  - documentation you are reading now
                        li
                            code /icons

                            |  - Images for demo purposes.
                        li
                            code /js
                            |  - JavaScript files

                            code /vendor
                            |  - 3rd party scripts and plugins - AOS, Bootstrap, jQuery, Masonry, etc.

                +componentDocItem('SCSS folder')
                
                    p  SCSS contains Bootstrap&rsquo;s and theme&rsquo;s SCSS sources structured in the following subfolders
                    ul
                        li <code>bootstrap</code> - full SCSS source for the Bootstrap framework.
                        li <code>theme</code> - theme overrides and custom components for this theme
                        li <code>style.default.scss</code> - main theme SCSS files that get compiled into theme main stylesheets style.default.css.
                        li <code>_core.scss</code> - file that handles all the SASS imports - mixins, Bootstrap and theme variables, Bootstrap framework
                        li <code>user/_user.scss</code> - a place for you to add your own custom CSS declarations to keep them separate from the core theme files, which aids updating.
                        li <code>user/_user-variables.scss</code> - a place for you to add your own SCSS variables to override the Bootstrap and theme defaults. This prevents the need to edit the core Bootstrap/theme files and prevents the problems from updating the theme.

                +componentDocItem('Dist folder')

                    p If you will be using the Gulp workflow, here is where the compiled files will be saved and the Browsersync server running from. Before you init Gulp, this directory is empty.

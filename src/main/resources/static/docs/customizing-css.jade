                            | <strong>The most flexible way to edit the theme CSS</strong> or to add your own code and components <strong>is to use SCSS</strong>. As mentioned before, there are two files already prepared for your changes -

                            |  and

                        p
                            | To configure the theme, e.g. to change colours for some elements, to change font sizes, etc., use  
                            code _user-variables.scss
                            | . Any variable from

                            |  can be overridden here with your own value. Just copy the line from the theme's/Bootstrap's _variables.scss config files, paste it here and replace the value with your own.

                        p
                            | To compile the SCSS, you can use the

                            |  <a href="gulp.html">included in this theme</a> (recommended) or you can download an app for your OS and compile it that way. In case you would be using an app, donâ€™t forget to add vendor prefixes to your code too (done by Autoprefixer in Gulp ).
